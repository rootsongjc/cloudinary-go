cloudinary put -i cover.jpg

Warning: database not set (upload sync disabled)
Default remote prepend path set to:  images/
==> PublicID: images/cover
==> Uploading as images

2017/10/29 14:49:06 URL: https://res.cloudinary.com/jimmysong/image/upload/images/cover.jpg
```

You can use `ls` to get the upload version.
